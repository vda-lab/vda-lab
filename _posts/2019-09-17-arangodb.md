## 1. Some issues with relational databases

Although relational databases have been used for multiple decades and are easy to get started with, they do have some shortcomings, particularly in the big data era that we're in now.

### 1.1 Scalability


### 1.2 Joins
Best practices in relational database design suggest that you should aim for a normalised design (see in our [previous post](REF)). This means that the different concepts in the data are separated out into tables, and can be _joined_ together again in a query. Unfortunately, joins can be very expensive. For example, the Ensembl database (www.ensembl.org) is fully normalised containing a total of 74 tables. For example, to get the exon positions for a given gene, one needs to run 3 joins.

![joins]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/rdbms-joins.png)

**GOING UP TO SEQ_REGION, BUT NOT TO CHROMOSOME**

The query to get the exon positions for `FAM39B protein`:
```
SELECT e.seq_region_start
FROM gene g, transcript t, exon_transcript et, exon e
WHERE g.description = 'FAM39B protein'
AND g.gene_id = t.gene_id
AND t.transcript_id = et.transcript_id
AND et.exon_id = e.exon_id;
```

### 1.3 Relational data
Suppose you need to work on a social graph and the data is stored in a relational database. People have names, and know other people. Every "know" is reciprocal (so if I know you then you know me too).

![friends]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/friends-relational.png)

Let's see what it means to follow relationships in a RDBMS. What would this look like if we were searching for friends of friends of James?

```
SELECT knowee FROM friends
WHERE knower IN (
  SELECT knowee FROM friends
  WHERE knower = 'James'
  )
UNION
SELECT knower FROM friends
WHERE knowee IN (
  SELECT knower FROM friends
  WHERE knowee = 'James'
  );
```
Quite verbose. What if we'd want to go one level deeper: all friends of friends of James?
```
SELECT knowee FROM friends
WHERE knower IN (
  SELECT knowee FROM friends
  WHERE knower IN (
    SELECT knowee FROM friends
    WHERE knower = 'James'
    )
  UNION
  SELECT knower FROM friends
  WHERE knowee IN (
    SELECT knower FROM friends
    WHERE knowee = 'James'
    )
  )
UNION
SELECT knower FROM friends
WHERE knowee IN (
  SELECT knower FROM friends
  WHERE knowee IN (
    SELECT knower FROM friends
    WHERE knowee = 'James'
    )
  UNION
  SELECT knowee FROM friends
  WHERE knower IN (
    SELECT knowee FROM friends
    WHERE knower = 'James'
    )
  );
```
This clearly does not scale, and we'll have to look for another solution.

## 2. Intermezzo: JSON
Before we proceed, we'll have a quick look at the JSON ("JavaScript Object Notation") text format, which is often used in different database systems. JSON follows the same principle as XML, in that it describes the data in the object itself. An example JSON object:

{% highlight json %}
{ code:"I0D54A",
  name:"Big Data",
  lecturer:"Jan Aerts",
  keywords:["data management","NoSQL","big data"],
  students:[
    {student_id:"u0359851", name:"Jariani Abbas"},
    {student_id:"u0290360", name:"Anurag Chaturvedi"},
    {student_id:"u0193120", name:"Stefanie De Coster"}]}
{% endhighlight %}

JSON has very simple syntax rules:
- Data is in key/value pairs. Each are in quotes, separated by a colon. In some cases you might omit the quotes around the key, but not always.
- Data is separated by commas.
- Curly braces hold objects.
- Square brackets hold arrays.

JSON values can be numbers, strings, booleans, arrays (i.e. lists), objects or NULL; JSON arrays can contain multiple values (including JSON objects); JSON objects contain one or more key/value pairs.

These are two JSON arrays:
{% highlight json %}
["data management","NoSQL","big data"]

[{student_id:"u0372837", name:"Jariani Abbas"},
 {student_id:"u9274918", name:"Anurag Chaturvedi"},
 {student_id:"u0183928", name:"Stefanie De Coster"}]
{% endhighlight %}

And a simple JSON object:
{% highlight json %}
{student_id:"u0372837", name:"Jariani Abbas"}
{% endhighlight %}

And objects can be nested as in the first example.

## 3. Types of NoSQL databases
There's a plethora of NoSQL database systems, but the most common are key/value stores, document-oriendted databases, column-oriented databases and graph databases.

### 3.1 Key-value stores
TODO

### 3.2 Document-oriented databases
In contrast to relational databases (RDBMS) which define their columns at the _table_ leves, document-oriented databases (also called document stores) define their fields at the _document_ level. You can imagine that a single row in a RDBMS table corresponds to a single document where the keys in the document correspond to the column names in the RDBMS.

Whereas you use a table _join_ in a RDBMS to combine different concepts/tables, you'd use linking or embedding in document stores.

A table join in RDBMS:
![joining]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/joining.png)

Linking and embedding in a document store:
![linking-embedding]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/linking-embedding.png)

This type of design has multiple advantages:
- The embedded objects are returned in the same query as the parent object, meaning that only 1 trip to the database is necessary. In the example above, if you'd query for a blog entry, you get the comments and tags with it for free.
- Objects in the same collection are generally stored sequentially on disk, leading to fast retrieval.
- If the document model matches your domain, it is much easier to understand than a normalised relational database.
