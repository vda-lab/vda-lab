As for the [vega-lite tutorial], make sure to have the [documentation webpage](https://vega.github.io/vega/docs/) open. The other important websites are:

- [vega website](https://vega.github.io/vega/)
- [examples](https://vega.github.io/vega/examples/)
- [tutorials](https://vega.github.io/vega/tutorials/)

Compared to vega-lite, vega provides more fine-grained control for composing interactive graphics, but is therefore also much more verbose. Whereas vega-lite provides decent defaults for, for example, scales and axes, this need to be made explicit in vega.

{:toc}

In this tutorial, we'll again use the online vega editor available at [https://vega.github.io/editor/](https://vega.github.io/editor/), but make sure that "Vega" is selected in the topleft dropdown box instead of "Vega-Lite".

## A simple barchart

Here's the specification for barest of scatterplots:

{% highlight json %}
{
  "$schema": "https://vega.github.io/schema/vega/v5.json",
  "width": 400,
  "height": 200,
  "padding": 5,

  "data": [
    {
      "name": "table",
      "values": [
        {"x": 15, "y": 8},
        {"x": 72, "y": 25},
        {"x": 35, "y": 44},
        {"x": 44, "y": 29}
      ]
    }
  ],

  "scales": [
    {
      "name": "xscale",
      "domain": {"data": "table", "field": "x"},
      "range": "width"
    },
    {
      "name": "yscale",
      "domain": {"data": "table", "field": "y"},
      "range": "height"
    }
  ],

  "marks": [
    {
      "type": "symbol",
      "from": {"data":"table"},
      "encode": {
        "enter": {
          "x": {"scale": "xscale", "field": "x"},
          "y": {"scale": "yscale", "field": "y"}
        }
      }
    }
  ]
}
{% endhighlight %}

giving you the following plot:

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/vega-barest-scatterplot.png" width="400px" />

Compared to [vega-lite]({{ site.baseurl }}/2019/12/vegalite), this is obviously much more verbose, and the resulting plot is just a bare collection of points without axes or axis labels. The vega-lite specification would have looked like this:

{% highlight json %}
{
  "$schema": "https://vega.github.io/schema/vega-lite/v4.json",
  "data": {
    "values": [
      {"x": 15, "y": 8},
      {"x": 72, "y": 25},
      {"x": 35, "y": 44},
      {"x": 44, "y": 29}
    ]
  },
  "mark": "circle",
  "encoding": {
    "x": {"field": "x", "type": "quantitative"},
    "y": {"field": "y", "type": "quantitative"}
  }
}
{% endhighlight %}

resulting in this plot:

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/vegalite-barest-scatterplot.png" width="300px"/>

What differences do we see in vega?

- `data` takes an _array_ instead of a single object
- The `mark` is a `symbol`. The default symbol is a circle.
- `encoding` is moved _within_ `marks` (now plural instead of the singular `mark`)
- The encodings include a `scale` for each element.
- There's an `enter` object within `encoding`.
- In the `marks` section we need to specify the data used by name.
- We have to define `scales` that we can use in the encoding.

## Scales
Scales (see their documentation [here](https://vega.github.io/vega/docs/scales/)) convert data from the original domain to a range that can be used for plotting. For example, imagine you have longitude data from a map. Locations on the earth have a longitude that is between -180 and 180. We want to plot this on a graph that is 800 pixels wide. If we'd just use the longitude for the `x` value, than any location west of Greenwich would be outside of the plot (because smaller than zero), and most of the right of the graphic would be empty (because there are no points in the range -180 to 800). We need to recalculate the positions: -180 (degrees) needs to become 0 (pixels), 0 (degrees) needs to become 400 (pixels) and 180 (degrees) needs to become 800 (pixels).

The most important keys for a scale are its `domain` and its `range`. The `domain` is the original space; the `range` is the target range. In the case of the longitude data:

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/vega-domainrange.png" width="600px" />

A `scale` also needs to have a name so that it can be referenced later. This is what the most simple scale for the conversion of  looks like:

{% highlight json %}
{
  "name": "myscale",
  "type": "linear",
  "domain": [-180,180],
  "range": [0,800]
},
{% endhighlight %}

The `linear` type of scale interpolates the target value linearly. The `domain` provides the minimum and maximum values of the source values; the `range` provides the minimum and maximum of the target values. To use this scale, we reference it in the encoding: `"x": {"scale": "myscale", "field": "longitude"}`.

Instead of providing a minimum and maximum value for `domain` or `range`, we can also provide just a single number which is then considered the maximum. This is what you see in the example above for `xscale`: `"range": "width"`.

Different types of scales exist, including `linear`, `sqrt`, `ordinal` etc. See the documentation at [https://vega.github.io/vega/docs/scales/#types](https://vega.github.io/vega/docs/scales/#types) for a full reference.

Scales are not only interesting for recalculating ranges, but they are used to assign colours to categories as well. We'll come back to those later.

## Changing colour
The points in the plot above are blue. In vega-lite, we'd just add `"color": {"value": "red"}` to the `encoding` section to change this. In vega, however, the keyword `color` is not recognised. Instead, a distinction is made between `fill` and `stroke`. `fill` corresponds to the area of the point itself; `stroke` refers to the _outline_ of the point (the _circle_).

{:.exercise}
**Exercise** - Change the colour of the points to red.

{:.exercise}
**Exercise** - Change the colour of the point _outline_ to green.

{:.exercise}
**Exercise** - In the previous exercise, you'll see that the outline is very thin. Check the documentation for a `symbol` at [https://vega.github.io/vega/docs/marks/symbol/](https://vega.github.io/vega/docs/marks/symbol/) to find out how to make this line thicker.

{:.exercise}
**Exercise** - Change the shape of the symbol from a circle to a square. Again: check the [documentation](https://vega.github.io/vega/docs/marks/symbol/).

{:.exercise}
**Exercise** - Let's try to have to colour of each point dependent on the data itself. Change the data so that each datapoint also has some colour assigned to it (e.g. `{"x": 15, "y": 8, "c": "yellow"},`) and adjust the encoding to use this colour.

### Using colour scales

#### Categorical colours
In the last exercise, we had to define the colour of each bar in the data itself. It'd be better if we can let vega pick the colour for us instead. This is where _colour scales_ come into play.

Vega helps you in assigning colours to datapoints, using a collection of colouring schemes available at [https://vega.github.io/vega/docs/schemes/](https://vega.github.io/vega/docs/schemes/). Instead of hard-coding the colour for each datapoint, let's give each datapoint a category instead and create a scale to assign colours.

{% highlight json %}
{
  "$schema": "https://vega.github.io/schema/vega/v5.json",
  "width": 400,
  "height": 200,
  "padding": 5,

  "data": [
    {
      "name": "table",
      "values": [
        {"x": 15, "y": 8, "category": "A"},
        {"x": 72, "y": 25, "category": "B"},
        {"x": 35, "y": 44, "category": "C"},
        {"x": 44, "y": 29, "category": "A"},
        {"x": 24, "y": 20, "category": "B"}
      ]
    }
  ],

  "scales": [
    {
      "name": "xscale",
      "domain": {"data": "table", "field": "x"},
      "range": "width"
    },
    {
      "name": "yscale",
      "domain": {"data": "table", "field": "y"},
      "range": "height"
    },
    {
      "name": "colourScale",
      "type": "ordinal",
      "domain": {"data": "table", "field": "category"},
      "range": {"scheme": "category10"}
    }
  ],

  "marks": [
    {
      "type": "symbol",
      "from": {"data":"table"},
      "encode": {
        "enter": {
          "x": {"scale": "xscale", "field": "x"},
          "y": {"scale": "yscale", "field": "y"},
          "size": {"value": 200},
          "fill": {"scale": "colourScale", "field": "category"}
        }
      }
    }
  ]
}
{% endhighlight %}

What we did here:
- We added a "category" to each datapoint. This does not have to be named "category", but can have any name.
- We created a new scale, called "colourScale". The `name`, `type` and `domain` are as we described above, but for the `range` we set `{"scheme": "category10"}`. `category10` is only one of the possible colour schemes, which are all listed on [https://vega.github.io/vega/docs/schemes/](https://vega.github.io/vega/docs/schemes/).
- For `fill` we now use the scale as well.
- Just to make the colour a bit more clear, we increased the size of the points as well...

The resulting plot:

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/vega-colourscheme.png" width="400px" />

As you can see, the points with the same category get the same colour.

#### Sequential colours
What if we'd want to have the colour depend not on a nominal value such as category, but on a numerical value? Let's say, on `x`.

Change the `colourScale` to:

{% highlight json %}
{
  "name": "colourScale",
  "type": "linear",
  "domain": {"data": "table", "field": "x"},
  "range": {"scheme": "blues"}
}
{% endhighlight %}

and change the `field` in `encoding` -> `fill` from `category` to `x`.

You'll get this image:

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/vega-bluecolourscale.png" width="400px" />

{:.exercise}
**Exercise** - We use `x` both in the definition of `colourScale` and as the `field` in the `encoding`. What would it mean if we'd use `x` in the definition of `colourScale`, but `y` in the `encoding`?

{:.exercise}
**Exercise** - Try out some of the diverging colour schemes mentioned on [https://vega.github.io/vega/docs/schemes/](https://vega.github.io/vega/docs/schemes/).

If you really want to, you can also set the colours by hand. For example, we want to have categories A and B be blue, and category C be red. To do this, we simply provide an array both for `domain` and `range`, like so:

{% highlight json %}
{
  "name": "colourScale",
  "type": "ordinal",
  "domain": ["A","B","C"],
  "range": ["blue","blue","red"]
}
{% endhighlight %}

## Enter - Update - Exit
Another difference that we see with vega-lite is the use of the `enter` tag. This is a very important concept that directly drills down into [D3](http://d3js.org) which is the javascript library underneath vega. To understand the concept, we need to make a clear distinction between marks on the screen, and the data underneath.

For the explanation below, take the initial state of 5 datapoints represented as 5 marks.

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/vega-enterupdateexit-initial.png" width="400px" />

### Enter
The `enter` pragma applies when there are more datapoints than marks on the screen. In the image, a new datapoint [6,1] is created, for which no mark exists yet. The visual encoding that should be applied to that datapoint is defined in the `encoding` -> `enter` section.

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/vega-enterupdateexit-enter.png" width="400px" />

### Update
Now let's change the value some of the datapoints. When the number of marks does not have to change, but they do not represent the correct data anymore, we apply an `update` (specified in the `encoding` -> `update` section). In the image below, it is the y-position that changed, but that might also be color, shape, size, etc of the mark.

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/vega-enterupdateexit-update.png" width="400px" />

### Exit
If after a change in the data there are more marks on the screen than necessary for showing the data (e.g. we go from 5 datapoints to 4), what should happen with the one mark that is still on the screen? It'll be left hanging, unless we actually remove it. That is what the `encoding` -> `exit` section is for.

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/vega-enterupdateexit-exit.png" width="400px" />

In the scatterplots above, only the `enter` is provided, because this is a static dataset that does not change over time (not even changing colour on hover). In other words: we start with a dataset with n datapoints, but no marks yet on the screen. Hence we need the `enter`.

## Axes
The current plot is still extremely bare, without any axes. So let's add those. See [https://vega.github.io/vega/docs/axes/](https://vega.github.io/vega/docs/axes/) for documentation.

To add axes to this plot, we merely add the following just before the `marks` section:
{% highlight json %}
...
"scales": ...,
"axes": [
  {"orient": "bottom", "scale": "xscale"},
  {"orient": "left", "scale": "yscale"}
],
"marks": ...
...
{% endhighlight %}

This will give you the following:

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/vega-axes.png" width="400px" />

For axes, you must provide the orientation (whether `top`, `bottom`, `left` or `right`), and the scale that decides where the ticks should come.

{:.exercise}
**Exercise** - Add these axes to your plot, but also add axis titles and grid lines.

          "fill": {"scale": "colourScale", "field": "category"}
        }
      }
    }
  ]
}
-->

## Legends
We now have a plot with points in different colours that are dependent upon the category, but we can't tell which colour is which category. Enter legends.

By default, a legend is placed in the top right. In our code above, we set the colour (`fill`) based on the scale `colourScale`. It is this scale that we need to make a legend for:

{% highlight json %}
"legends": [
  {
    "fill": "colourScale"
  }
],
{% endhighlight %}

We used `fill` because it corresponds to the encoding pragma that we need the legend for, and `colourScale` because that is the scale that we used in the encoding.

Of course there are other types of legends as well. Let's for example change `"size": {"value": 200}` to `"size": {"scale": "yscale", "field": "y"}`. Our legend would then be:

{% highlight json %}
"legends": [
  {
    "size": "yscale"
  }
],
{% endhighlight %}

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/vega-legendyscale.png" width="400px" />

But wait... This doesn't look right. We'd expect that points with a larger value for `y` are larger, and that to be true for the legend as well. It seems that the yscale is the wrong way around. Also, we've lost a datapoint!

A solution to this is to create a second scale (e.g. `yscalereversed`) and use that one for the `size` and the legend. We'll still use the original `yscale` for the position along the Y-axis.

{% highlight json %}
{
  "$schema": "https://vega.github.io/schema/vega/v5.json",
  "width": 400,
  "height": 200,
  "padding": 5,

  "data": [
    {
      "name": "table",
      "values": [
        {"x": 15, "y": 8, "category": "A"},
        {"x": 72, "y": 25, "category": "B"},
        {"x": 35, "y": 44, "category": "C"},
        {"x": 44, "y": 29, "category": "A"},
        {"x": 24, "y": 20, "category": "B"}
      ]
    }
  ],

  "scales": [
    {
      "name": "xscale",
      "domain": {"data": "table", "field": "x"},
      "range": "width"
    },
    {
      "name": "yscale",
      "domain": {"data": "table", "field": "y"},
      "range": "height"
    },
        {
      "name": "yscalereversed",
      "domain": {"data": "table", "field": "y"},
      "range": "height",
      "reverse": true
    },
    {
      "name": "colourScale",
      "type": "ordinal",
      "domain": {"data": "table", "field": "category"},
      "range": {"scheme": "category10"}
    }
  ],
  "axes": [
    {"orient": "bottom", "scale": "xscale", "grid": true},
    {"orient": "left", "scale": "yscale", "grid": true}
  ],
  "legends": [
    {
      "size": "yscalereversed"
    }
  ],
  "marks": [
    {
      "type": "symbol",
      "from": {"data":"table"},
      "encode": {
        "enter": {
          "x": {"scale": "xscale", "field": "x"},
          "y": {"scale": "yscale", "field": "y"},
          "size": {"scale": "yscalereversed", "field": "y"},
          "fill": {"scale": "colourScale", "field": "category"}
        }
      }
    }
  ]
}
{% endhighlight %}

This looks more like what we expect:

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/vega-legendyscalereversed.png" width="400px" />

Why did we loose that datapoint? That's because the scale went from 0 to the height. The datapoint `{"x": 15, "y": 8, "category": "A"}` has a value of 8, so it's not at the minimum of 0. The datapoint `{"x": 35, "y": 44, "category": "C"}`, however, was mapped to the maximum value.
