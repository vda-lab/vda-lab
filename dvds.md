As data becomes easier and cheaper to generate, we are moving from a hypothesis-driven to data-driven paradigm in scientific research. As a result, we don't only need to find ways to answer any questions we have, but also to identify interesting questions/hypotheses in that data in the first place. In other words: we need to be able to dig through these large and complex datasets in search for unexpected patterns that - once discovered - can be investigated further using regular statistics and machine learning. Interactive data visualization provides a methodology for just that: to allow the user (be they domain expert or lay user) to find those questions, and to give them deep insight in their data.

Content:
* Background and context of data visualization and visual data analysis
* Design as a process: framing the problem, ideation, sketching, design critique, ...
* Programming visualizations: static and dynamic
* Project: visualization of expert dataset

### Exercise for static visualisation
Based on any dataset (but preferably using the dataset you used in the previous exercise), create a new data visualisation to demonstrate a non-obvious insight gleaned from the data, to make a particular point, or to present an interesting overview of the datasets. If you want, you can also create a data-driven art piece. Good examples are:
* [https://www.studioterp.nl/](https://www.studioterp.nl/)
* [http://visme.co/blog/best-data-visualizations/](http://visme.co/blog/best-data-visualizations/) =>
    * History of Bruse Springsteen
    * Hello Sun app
    * Apollo
    * Keuzestress: Searching for the "Correct" Mascara
    * The Women of Dataviz
    * Oddity Viz (data art)
    * Red Bull Party Visualization (data art)

We will do this exercise in 2 phases:
1. In the session of 14/5, we'll go over hand-drawn sketches. Please present **1** design; we'll expect you to have gone through the diverge-emerge-converge cycle yourself beforehand.
1. In the session of 21/5, you'll present the final visual.

In your visual, please include:
* the visual itself
* a good title
* a short description of what this is about
* a legend
* highlights of any interesting things you want to draw attention to

Here's another very good example of a visual with annotations:
